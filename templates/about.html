<h1> About Me<h2>
My name is Portia Burton.

<hr>
I'm an engineer, but an educator at heart.  I love to share what I learn, and have 
extensive experience teaching and talking about data science and other techy subjects.
If you are interested in getting your team up to speed on the latest applications of
data science drop me a line.
